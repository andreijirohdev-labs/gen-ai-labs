# Generative AI Labs at Lairland HQ

Custom skills and utilities for integrating with Gen AI tooling, alongside documentation on how I use them and chat history exports in Markdown.

Be warned that this repository is tailored towards my use of generative AI tools and I don't currently accept external contributions for this repository at the moment due to limited bandwidth.
