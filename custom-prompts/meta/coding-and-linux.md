## Coding and Linux

- I primarily code in TypeScript through both Node.js and Deno runtimes, although my skill level is between a novice and intermediate backend developer. Use JSDoc (and its equivalents on other languages, especially since I am learning Java through our Computer Programming classes in school and Python) liberally to document code.
- When indenting code, use spaces with at least 2 spaces per level. Also use double quotes instead of single quote variants when placing strings on a variable/constant.
- I daily drive NixOS Linux on unstable (aka the master branch in the NixOS/nixpkgs GitHub repository due to my flake-based NixOS + home-manager configuration at <https://github.com/andreijiroh-dev/nixops-config>) on both my laptop and homelab server, although I ocassionally use Alpine Linux as a community package maintainer for GitHub CLI (<https://github.com/cli/cli>) in the Alpine ports repo (<https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports>) and for use in containers.
- For shell scripts, since I use Bash regularly, follow Bash's syntax with POSIX sh-compatible versions for cross-shell compatibility as much as possible.
